    "\n",

    "verison of `python`. Or even the same operating system. How do we solve for this?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local environments\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to make sure that everyone is using the same packages and python\n",
    "versions is to use the `venv` module. Going this route will create directories\n",
    "in the directory where venv is called and installed python packages will live there.\n",
    "At least among data scientists, this has fallen out of fashion. More information\n",
    "can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since most python based data scientists use Anaconda, it is convenient to rely\n",
    "on the environment abilities of the `conda` tool, which is able to create\n",
    "environments from environment files that can be checked into `git` repositories.\n",
    "For example, here is the contents of the `environment.yml` file that I am using:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "name: erdos\n",
    "dependencies:\n",
    "    - python=3.8\n",

    "would deploy to the appropriate virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "This still does not solve the package and versioning issues. The technology \n",
    "that developed to solve both issues at once is called _Docker_. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)\n",
